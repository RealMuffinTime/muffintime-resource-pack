Hello there,

With best regards
RealMuffinTime

## Features

1. A rainbow XP bar.

2. Furnaces have the name "DOOOOOOOG".

3. The totem has been changed to a UNO Reverse Card.

4. The text of the totem has been adjusted to be fitting for a UNO Reverse Card.

5. The cookie texture has been changed to the MuffinTime logo.

6. A ahegao totem has been added, it applies to totems which are named "".
   Use `/data merge entity @e[type=minecraft:item, sort=nearest, limit=1, nbt={Item:{id:"minecraft:totem_of_undying"}}] {Item: {tag: {"CustomModelData":69}}}` to assign the new model. (To use this the totem needs to be an dropped.)

   Use `/data merge entity @e[type=minecraft:item, sort=nearest, limit=1, nbt={Item:{id:"minecraft:totem_of_undying"}}] {Item: {tag: {"CustomModelData":0}}}` to assign the standart model.
